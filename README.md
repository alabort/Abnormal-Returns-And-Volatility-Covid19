# Bachelor thesis project

This dissertation aims to evaluate the effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 on the stock indices ofthe most affected countries and on the shares of the worldâ€™s largest airlines. The performed analysis employs a multiple level research to assess the impact of COVID-19 on: (1) abnormal returns  associated  to  the  stock  indices  of  the  most  affected  countries,  (2)  abnormal  returns associated with airline stocks, (3) historical volatility of past returns associated with airline stocks and market indices, (4) alteration of market expectations after the initial diffusion of the virus. The  majority  of  the performed testinvolved  the  comparison  of  the  performance  in  terms  of returns and volatility in the period before the global awareness for the virus increased and, in the period when various countries were seriously affected by COVID-19.COVID-19 has been negatively affecting stock markets worldwide. The results indicate that the stock  indices  in  most  affected  countries plummetedafter  the  virus  outbreakand  specifically, analyzed European countries experienced more negative abnormal returns than China. Moreover, airline stocks were more sensitive in terms of returns to the diffusion of COVID-19 in comparison to market  indices  including  stocks  from  other  sectors.  The  analysis  found  some evidence indicatinga  structural  breachin  the  sector  due  to increased  volatility  and  pessimistic  investor expectations. Risk Neutral Densities revealed an increase in negativeinvestorsentimentand an uncertain future for the airline industry.
